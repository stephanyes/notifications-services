# This is a proyect for Plataforma 5 - Bootcamp v2

We took inspiration from our Tutor Juan Ignacio Paz - https://github.com/juanip84/notifications-service (original repo)

As we continue to build this proyect we will be uploading more content

We need to implement a notifications service for our API of supermercados.

The idea is that when an user is registered he is notified with a welcome message or something like that.
